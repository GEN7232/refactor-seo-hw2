In this project I refactored existing code for search engine optimization. First I added alt attributes to each of the images. Then I changed all the div tags to a semantic html tag. I also had to fix the link for "Search Engine Optimization" so it went to that section on the page. I then had to change the CSS to match the new html tags, and I got rid of the redundant CSS sections.
